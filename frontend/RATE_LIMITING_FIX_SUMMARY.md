# Rate Limiting Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The pricing page was experiencing "Rate limit exceeded. Please wait 60 seconds before trying again." errors due to multiple simultaneous API calls to `/api/payment/plans`.

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Duplicate API Calls**: The `PricingPlans` component was making its own API call via `useEffect` while the `PaymentContext` was also triggering `paymentStore.refreshAll()` which called `fetchSubscriptionPlans()`.

2. **No Caching**: Each component re-render or user interaction could trigger new API calls without any caching mechanism.

3. **Backend Rate Limiting**: The `/api/payment/plans` endpoint has strict rate limits:
   - 10 requests per 5 minutes per user
   - 15 burst limit
   - 15-minute penalty on violation

## Solution Implemented

### 1. TanStack Query Integration

- **Installed**: `@tanstack/react-query` for advanced caching and state management
- **Configured**: QueryClient with appropriate cache settings in `main.tsx`
- **Created**: Custom hook `useSubscriptionPlans()` with 30-minute cache time

### 2. Updated PricingPlans Component

- **Removed**: Manual `useEffect` and `useState` for plans fetching
- **Added**: TanStack Query integration with `useSubscriptionPlans()`
- **Improved**: Error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Enhanced**: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff

### 3. Payment Store Optimization

- **Disabled**: Duplicate `fetchSubscriptionPlans()` calls in `refreshAll()`
- **Maintained**: Other payment data fetching (subscription, credits)
- **Preserved**: Existing functionality while eliminating redundant calls

### 4. Caching Strategy

- **Stale Time**: 30 minutes (plans rarely change)
- **Cache Time**: 1 hour (keeps data in memory)
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Refetch Control**: Disabled automatic refetching on focus/mount/reconnect

## Files Modified

1. **`frontend/src/main.tsx`** - Added QueryClient provider
2. **`frontend/src/hooks/useSubscriptionPlans.ts`** - New custom hook with caching
3. **`frontend/src/components/PricingPlans.tsx`** - Updated to use TanStack Query
4. **`frontend/src/store/paymentStore.ts`** - Disabled duplicate plan fetching

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Rate Limiting**: Plans are fetched once and cached for 30 minutes
2. **Better Performance**: No redundant API calls on component re-renders
3. **Improved UX**: Faster page loads and better error handling
4. **Scalable**: TanStack Query provides advanced features like background updates
5. **Maintainable**: Centralized data fetching logic

## Testing

The solution has been tested and verified:

- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ TanStack Query properly integrated
- ✅ Duplicate API calls eliminated

## Usage

The pricing page now:

1. Fetches plans once on first load
2. Caches data for 30 minutes
3. Shows loading states appropriately
4. Handles errors gracefully
5. Allows manual refresh if needed

The rate limiting issue should now be completely resolved, ensuring the pricing page is always accessible for user acquisition and conversion.
