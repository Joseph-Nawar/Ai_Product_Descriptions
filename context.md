# 🚀 Two-Person Execution Plan for *"AI Product Descriptions for E-commerce"*

⚠️ **Note:** I am **👤 Person 2 (Front-End & Quality Workflow Developer)**, **not Person 1**. Make sure all instructions, ownership, and contributions are understood with that in mind.

---

## Part 1: Work Division & Detailed Roles

### 👤 Person 1: AI Workflow Developer (Content Pipeline)

**Goal:** Build the back-end pipeline that takes product details (title, category, features) → structured prompts → AI-generated drafts.  

**Responsibilities:**
- Tool Research & Setup
- Prompt Engineering
- Batch Generation Script
- Basic SEO Enrichment  

---

### 👤 Person 2: Front-End & Quality Workflow Developer (UI + Editing Layer)  
➡️ **This is my role. I am Person 2.**

**Goal:** Build the front-end interface and create a smooth workflow for refining/editing the AI outputs.  

**Responsibilities:**
- UI/UX Design  
- Integration with Person 1’s Pipeline  
- Export Module  
- Brand Styling  

---

## Part 2: Workflow Breakdown (Step-by-Step)

🔹 **Phase 1: Setup (Both Together)**  
- Create GitHub repo with branches (main, dev, feat/*).  
- Agree on folder structure (prompts/, scripts/, frontend/, outputs/, deliverables/).  
- Install tools (Python/Node.js, React.js + TailwindCSS, GitHub Projects).  

🔹 **Phase 2: Development**  
- Person 1 (Pipeline): Write AI script for CSV → GPT API → save outputs.  
- **Person 2 (Me): Build skeleton React app** (Upload CSV → display placeholder table).  

🔹 **Phase 3: Integration**  
- Person 1 exposes API or shared JSON.  
- **Person 2 connects UI** to display generated descriptions dynamically.  

🔹 **Phase 4: Refinement**  
- Add SEO check in editor.  
- Add tone/style presets.  
- Validate with 50 sample products.  

🔹 **Phase 5: Packaging for Freelance Platforms**  
- Export polished bundles (Fashion Pack, Electronics Pack, Generic Pack).  
- Upload to Fiverr, Upwork, Gumroad.

## Part 3: GitHub Collaboration Rules  

- Branch Convention:  
  - Person 1: `feat/ai-pipeline`  
  - **Person 2 (Me): `feat/ui-dashboard`**  

- Commit Examples:  
  - `feat: add CSV parser for AI input`  
  - `ui: build product review table component`  

- PR Reviews: Each reviews the other’s PR before merge.  
- Only merge to **main** when deliverables are client-ready.  

---

✅ This way, both people are coding, both are responsible for product development, and both directly contribute to final deliverables.  
- Person 1 ensures AI automation is strong.  
- **Person 2 (me) ensures the UI is professional and export-ready.**
