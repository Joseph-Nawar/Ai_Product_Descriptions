# Credit-Based Rate Limiting Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of credit-based rate limiting for the AI Product Descriptions API. The system enforces usage limits based on subscription tiers and deducts credits for different types of operations.

## ✅ Implementation Summary

All requirements from **Prompt 3** have been successfully implemented:

### 1. Credit-Based Rate Limiting ✅
- ✅ Check user credits before allowing generation
- ✅ Deduct credits after successful generation
- ✅ Different credit costs for different operations
- ✅ Subscription tier limits
- ✅ Appropriate error messages when credits are exhausted
- ✅ Credit balance in API responses
- ✅ Credit refresh logic for monthly subscriptions

### 2. Modified Endpoints ✅
All specified endpoints have been updated:
- ✅ `/api/generate-batch`
- ✅ `/api/generate-batch-csv`
- ✅ `/api/regenerate`
- ✅ `/api/generate-description`

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CreditService** (`backend/src/payments/credit_service.py`)
   - Main service for credit-based rate limiting
   - Handles credit calculations, validation, and deduction
   - Manages subscription tier limits and refresh logic

2. **OperationType Enum**
   - Defines different types of operations that consume credits
   - Maps to specific credit costs

3. **Enhanced API Endpoints**
   - All AI generation endpoints now include credit checking
   - Comprehensive error responses with upgrade prompts
   - Credit balance information in responses

## 💳 Credit System

### Operation Types and Costs

| Operation | Credit Cost | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Single Description | 1 credit | Generate one product description |
| Batch Small (5-10 products) | 5 credits | Generate 5-10 product descriptions |
| Batch Large (10+ products) | 10 credits | Generate 10+ product descriptions |
| Regeneration | 1 credit | Regenerate a single description |
| CSV Upload | 1 credit per product | Process CSV file with product data |

### Subscription Tier Limits

| Tier | Monthly Credits | Features |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Free** | 10 credits | Basic AI generation, CSV upload |
| **Basic** | 100 credits | Enhanced AI generation, email support |
| **Pro** | 500 credits | Priority support, custom templates, API access |
| **Enterprise** | Unlimited | White label, custom integrations |

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Credit Checking Flow

1. **Pre-Generation Check**
   ```python
   # Check and refresh credits if needed
   await credit_service.check_and_refresh_credits(user_id)
   
   # Validate credits and limits
   can_proceed, credit_info = await credit_service.check_credits_and_limits(
       user_id, operation_type, product_count
   )
   ```

2. **Credit Deduction**
   ```python
   # Deduct credits after successful generation
   deduct_success, deduct_result = await credit_service.deduct_credits(
       user_id, operation_type, product_count, request_id=request_id
   )
   ```

### Error Responses

When credits are insufficient, the API returns HTTP 402 (Payment Required) with detailed information:

```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient credits. Required: 5, Available: 2",
  "upgrade_required": true,
  "current_credits": 2,
  "required_credits": 5,
  "subscription_tier": "free",
  "operation_type": "batch_small",
  "rate_limits": {
    "requests_per_minute": 5,
    "requests_per_hour": 50
  }
}
```

### API Response Enhancement

All generation endpoints now include credit information:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "product_123",
    "title": "Generated Product Title",
    "description": "Generated description...",
    "credits_used": 1,
    "remaining_credits": 9,
    "operation_type": "single_description",
    "subscription_tier": "free"
  }
}
```

## 🚀 New Endpoints

### GET `/api/user/credits`
Get comprehensive user credit information:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user_id": "user_123",
    "current_credits": 8,
    "total_credits_purchased": 10,
    "total_credits_used": 2,
    "credits_used_this_period": 2,
    "subscription_tier": "free",
    "tier_limit": 10,
    "is_unlimited": false,
    "credits_remaining_this_period": 8,
    "next_credit_refresh": "2024-02-01T00:00:00Z",
    "subscription_active": true,
    "credit_costs": {
      "single_description": 1,
      "batch_small": 5,
      "batch_large": 10,
      "regeneration": 1,
      "csv_upload": 1
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Credit Refresh Logic

### Monthly Subscription Refresh
- Credits are automatically refreshed at the start of each billing period
- Users get their full monthly credit allocation
- Period usage is reset to 0

### Free Tier Behavior
- Free tier users get 10 credits per month
- Credits reset on a 30-day cycle
- No payment required for refresh

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Credit cost calculations
- ✅ Operation type determination
- ✅ Subscription tier limits
- ✅ All requirements validation

### Test Results
```
📊 Test Results: 3/3 tests passed
🎉 All tests passed! Credit-based rate limiting is working correctly.
